# Skip Auth

For that one friend who can't switch to a Microsoft account.

## Usage

1. Install the [No Chat Reports mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports/). This is required to patch out chat reporting, which would otherwise cause problems.
   - This is not an ideological issue. If you do not install No Chat Reports, all players will be kicked on chat messages.
2. Install this mod.
3. Add offline players by id with `/skipauth add <username> <ip address>`. Subnets are allowed.
4. If the whitelist is enabled, whitelist offline players with `/skipauth whitelist <username>`. The standard whitelist command will not work.
